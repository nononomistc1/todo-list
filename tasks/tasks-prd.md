## Relevant Files

- `todo-app/scripts/app.js` - Main application logic for managing todos and orchestrating features.
- `todo-app/scripts/storage.js` - Handles saving, loading, and migrating tasks in localStorage.
- `todo-app/scripts/ui.js` - Manages UI rendering, event handling, and DOM updates.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
